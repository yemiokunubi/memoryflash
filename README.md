  No outside resources were used.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
The challenge that I had in this project was working with the nested if statements that handle the user’s guesses and whether or not they chose the wrong button. The included flow chart helped with understanding the game logic and the possible outcomes throught the course of a game. The weather I made it work at first was to hard coded and provide the code as if the user did everything right and won the game. Once I made that situation worked it was easy to add the else statements for when they chose the wrong thing or for when their turn was over. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) [YOUR ANSWER HERE]
When I click on one of the boxes, it highlights that box, and I'm wondering if that highlight can go away because I don't see that on other web pages when I click on things. I'm not sure if it's just a glitch tool or if that is something that can be changed. Besides that, I don't have specific questions about web development but it was very interesting and fun to work on different web capabilities during this project. This project gave me an intensified interest to work with more web capabilities such as scrolling on a web page, profiles for a user, and working more with a user’s choice.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) YOUR ANSWER HERE]
If I had more time to work on this project I definitely would have changed the sound and instead of those tone pitches I would have just made it a short melodical sound more pleasing to the ears. I had time to speed up the crew playback which was really fun to implement. I was also able to add an image to every button , if I had more time I would have limited it for the image to only show when the button is pressed.
